# openframework_boilerplate
A boiler plate for OpenFramework on Ubuntu

# Note
This is mostly a thing you can copy paste to get things running, not a build oriented project. I provided the makefile because it is usefull to have them

# Where to start
https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/

Make sure you have the complete build chain installed and ready to go on your machine. Generate a new project and just cut copy the c++ src file in your new project! 

# Command
make // compile 
make run // run
